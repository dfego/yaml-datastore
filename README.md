# YAML Datastore

A Rust crate that provides an! API for using a set of YAML files as a cohesive datastore.

What this crate supports is having a set of YAML files be accessible as a single, uniform datastore.
So for example, if you had a set of YAML files all containing structured data, you could use this crate
to query specific values from it. In effect, it's an ergonomic wrapper for managing a set of files
doing the file I/O, and pulling specific elements out of those files.

Still a work in progress, examples to come.
